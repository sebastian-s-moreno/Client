# Gui testing
In this session, you will use Playwright to perform end-to-end GUI testing. You can find the documentation for Playwright here: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro. Use this to find different ways to solve the following tasks.

## Navigation Bar
1. Test the different pages in the navigation bar, and verify that the correct URL is loaded.
