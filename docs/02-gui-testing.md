# Gui testing
In this session, you will use Playwright to perform end-to-end GUI testing. You can find the documentation for Playwright here: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro. Use this to find different ways to solve the following tasks. 

## Create your first Playwright script
Start by creating a folder in `/src/` of the front-end project called "Tests". As the name implies, this folder will contain everything related to tests for the front-end part of the application. Open the folder in the editor of your choice and install **Playwright** and **Playwright test runner** as explained in the installation document. 

```powershell
npm i -D playwright
npm i -D @playwright/test 
```

For our first test script we will verify that the Youtube-video in the Forecast 2050 page is available. 

Start by creating a new .js-file with a descriptive name, e.g. `CheckExternalVideo.spec.js`.

Now begins the task of writing a script that goes through the suited steps and verifications. For this test we created a starting point with the `npx playwright codegen "https://localhost:7276/"` command. After clicking on the Forecast 2050 page, we pressed the play button on the video. 
These actions gave the following code:

``` javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Go to https://localhost:7276/
  await page.goto('https://localhost:7276/');
  // Click text=Forecast 2050
  await page.click('text=Forecast 2050');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://localhost:7276/Forecast');
  // Click [aria-label="Play"]
  await page.frame({
    url: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FOyzK33L0Y'
  }).click('[aria-label="Play"]');
```

Replace the top line with
``` javascript
// import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'; <-Replace this line
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
```
and paste the code into your script. Try to run the script with 
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

Notice that the script fails. The error message reads 
```
"TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'click')", meaning await page.frame({url: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FOyzK33L0Y'}) return null. 
```
A quick view on the Forecast page with DevTools does however confirm that our page contains an iframe with src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FOyzK33L0Y", so the error message seems a bit strange. 

What has happened here is that Playwright is too quick when executing the script. The browser does not have time to load the element before Playwright tries to find it. To combat this issue, we ask Playwright to wait for the page to be fully loaded using the line: 
``` javascript
await page.waitForLoadState(); 
```
You may be tempted to set a hard wait of X seconds, but this could easily fail if the internet connection is bad, or you could end up waiting unnecessarily long.
 
This example shows that you cannot always trust the codegen-tool blindly. Some adjustments might be necessary. 

To finish the test script, we create a new variable that contains the iframe and add an extra expect-statement to verify that the title of the video is correct. We also gave the test function a more descriptive name. This leaves us with the following:

``` javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Check youtube video', async ({ page }) => {
  // Go to https://localhost:7276/
  await page.goto('https://localhost:7276/');
  // Click text=Forecast 2050
  await page.click('text=Forecast 2050');
  // Check the URL
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://localhost:7276/Forecast');
  // Wait for the page to load
  await page.waitForLoadState();
  // Create a variable that contains the iframe
  const iframe = await page.frame({url: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FOyzK33L0Y'});
  // Click [aria-label="Play"]
  await iframe.click('[aria-label="Play"]');
  // Check the title of the video
  await expect(iframe.locator('.ytp-title-link')).toContainText('VÃ¦rvarsel for vinteren 2050');
});
```
This script will verify

- That you can go the home page
- That the Forecast-tab is displayed on the home page and that you can click on it
- That the Forecast-page has the correct URL and is loaded
- That there is an iframe with a specific URL source
- That there is a clickable play button in the iframe
- That the name of the video in the iframe is what we expect
